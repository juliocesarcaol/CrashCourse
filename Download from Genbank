## Introduction

This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to download sequences from GenBank using R. We will use the `rentrez` package, which provides an interface to the NCBI's E-utilities API, making it easy to search and download data from GenBank.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have R and RStudio installed on your computer. You will also need to install the `rentrez` package if you haven't already. You can install it using the following command:

```r
install.packages("rentrez")

Load the rentrez Package

First, we need to load the rentrez package.

r

library(rentrez)

Search for Sequences

Use the entrez_search function to search for sequences in GenBank. For example, let's search for sequences related to the "cytochrome c oxidase I" gene in humans.

r

search_results <- entrez_search(db = "nucleotide", term = "cytochrome c oxidase I[Gene] AND Homo sapiens[Organism]", retmax = 10)
search_results

If You Know Accession Numbers

If you already have the accession numbers for the sequences you are interested in, you can use them directly:

r

accession_numbers <- c("KY494226", "KY494238", "JN371032", "JN104675", "KY494235", "KY494239", "KY494237", "KY494210", "KY627806", "KY627807", "KY494225", "KY494227", "KY494231", "KY494234", "KY627790", "KY494230", "KY627792", "KY627791", "KY627797", "KY627795", "KY494229", "KY627804", "KY627803", "JN104682", "JN104684", "JN371034", "KU724442", "KU724441", "KU724443", "JN370957", "JN370957", "MHUAA12483", "MHUAA10208", "MHUAA12482", "MHUAA7855", "MHUAA7638",
                                "MHUAA7455", "MHUAA8952", "ICN55788", "MHUAA8951", "OM339541", "MW504199", "MW504201", "MW504200", "MW504202", "MW504203")
database <- "nucleotide"
filename <- "sequences.fasta"

Fetch Sequence Data

Once we have the IDs of the sequences we're interested in, we can use the entrez_fetch function to download the sequence data. We'll download the sequences in FASTA format.

r

sequences <- rentrez::entrez_fetch(db = database, 
                                   id = accession_numbers, 
                                   rettype = "fasta")

Save Sequences to a File

To save the downloaded sequences to a file, we can use the following code:

r

writeLines(sequences, filename)

Usability

This process will save the sequences in FASTA format to a file named sequences.fasta.
